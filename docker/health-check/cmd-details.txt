-interval=DURATION (30s by default)
-timeout=DURATION (30s by default)
-start-period=DURATION (0s by default).
retries should be set to N (default: 3)


The timeout option controls the amount of time Docker health checks waits for an exit code to be returned before deeming your health check failed ( therefore deeming your container unhealthy).

A docker health check should be executed within an interval of seconds defined by the interval option. Additionally, the frequency of recurrent health checks will be determined.

You can specify the start-period option to determine how long your container needs to bootstrap. The container will not be supposed unhealthy if the Docker health check's exit code is greater than zero; however, it will be deemed healthy if the exit code is 0.

The number of simultaneous failures at the docker health check that must arise before a container is labelled unhealthy is confined by the retries option.


exit code

0 – A healthy and functioning container.

1 – Containers are unhealthy, and workloads may not be working.
